<h2>My Visit to Tolstoy.</h2>

<p class="center smcap">A Discourse, at Temple Keneseth Israel<br />
by<br />
Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, D. D.</p>

<p class="center p2">Philadelphia, December 11th, 1910.</p>



<p class="is">My visit to Russia
and its purpose.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1894 I visited Russia for the purpose
of proposing to the Czar a plan that might end or lessen the
terrible persecution of the Jews in his realm.
The plan intended was a removal of the persecuted
Jews to unoccupied lands in the interior, there to be
colonized on farms, and to be maintained, until self-supporting,
by their correligionists of other parts of the world.</p>


<p class="is">Refused admission by
Russian government.</p>

<p>Learning that, because a Jew, I would not be admitted
into Russia, I conferred with President Cleveland and Secretary
Gresham, both of whom heartily endorsed
my plan and resolved to intervene. The Russian
Minister at Washington declaring his powerlessness
to <i>visé</i> my passport, our Secretary of State cabled to the
American Minister at St. Petersburg to obtain the desired
permission from the foreign office, only to receive as reply the
words "<i>Russian government deeply regrets its inability to accede
to request in behalf of Reverend Jewish divine</i>."</p>


<p class="is">Determined to test my
citizenship right.</p>

<p>The injustice of the reply determined me more than ever
to enter Russia, if only to make a test case of my citizenship
rights. The treaty between the United States
and Russia guarantees to every American citizen
the right of entry on Russian soil, and as an
American citizen that right was mine; my religion being my
private affair and no concern of Russia's. The determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to test the supremacy of international law over national prejudice
aroused a large part of the American press to a vigorous
endorsement of my position. A bill was introduced in
Congress to the effect that the treaty between the two countries
be declared abrogated if an American citizen be turned
back from the gates of Russia by reason of his religion.</p>


<p class="is">Was admitted.</p>

<p>In the height of the agitation I departed for Russia,
knocked at the gates of St. Petersburg&mdash;and was admitted.
Russia had evidently come to the conclusion
that it was better policy to admit me and to keep
her eyes on me than to allow the agitation and the indignation
to continue in our country.</p>


<p class="is">Met distinguished
Russians.</p>

<p>While within the Russian borders, I was privileged to
come in contact with many prominent Russians, one of them
M. Witte, who at that time was Minister of
Finance and practically at the head of the empire,
the Czar, Alexander III, being critically ill in the Crimea,
where he shortly after died.</p>


<p class="is">Tolstoy most
distinguished of all.</p>

<p>But of all the men I met none made the impression that
was left upon me by my visit to Count Leo Tolstoy. It was
made possible by Mr. Andrew D. White, the distinguished
scholar and statesman, who at that
time represented our country at St. Petersburg. He had
written and asked the count to meet me and to learn of the
mission that brought me to Russia. The count's daughter,
Tatiana, replied that her father would be pleased to have me
visit him, adding that he was just then engaged in hay-making,
and, therefore, had not much leisure. To take as little of his
time as possible I arranged to arrive in the court-yard of his
manor-house at Yasnaya Polyana, late in the afternoon.
Approaching a group of peasants that stood at a well drinking
water and mopping their brows, my travelling-companion, a
young Russian lawyer, asked them where we might find the
count. One of them stepped out of the group, and, lifting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his cap, said most courteously that he was Tolstoy, and,
learning my name, he bade me a hearty welcome.</p>


<p class="is">Held me captive from
first meeting.</p>

<p>From the moment I first gazed upon him he held me
captive, and, by a strange psychic power, he has held me enthralled
ever since. No wish of mine has been
more fondly cherished in the sixteen years that
have since passed by than that of some day visiting Russia
again, and only for the purpose of seeing once more that
strangely fascinating personality, of listening again to his
marvelous flow of wisdom.</p>


<p class="is">His personality.</p>

<p>I had often wondered how a Moses, an Isaiah, a Jeremiah,
a Socrates, looked and talked, denounced and dreamed, the
moment I saw and heard Tolstoy I knew. One
hour's talk with him seemed equal to a whole
university course in political and social science; one walk
with him on his estate stored up in the listener more knowledge
of moral philosophy than could be crowded into a year's
seminary instruction. Great as was the power of his pen,
immeasurably greater was the power of his living word. In
some mysterious way the flow of his speech seemed to exercise
an hypnotic spell upon the speaker as much as upon the
listener. The speaker seemed at times translated into a super-human
being, seemed inspired, seemed to speak words not his
own, as one of the ancient prophets of Israel must have spoken
when he said the words: "Thus saith the Lord," while the
listener seemed scarcely capable of thought or speech, felt his
being almost lose its identity and become merged with that of
the speaker.</p>

<p>At times his voice would sound as Elijah's voice must
have sounded when he said to Ahab, the king, "Thou art he
who troubleth Israel," and at times it would seem as sweet as
the voice of one of Russia's nightingales. At times his strong,
rugged, bearded face would resemble that of the pictured
Jupiter in wrath, and then it would rival in serenity one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Raphael's saints. At times he would seem to carry on his
shoulders all the woe of the world, resembling one of the
mediaeval pictures of the martyr of Nazareth, and then again
he would seem as care-free and happy as a little babe. He
had never learned the art of concealing his thoughts and emotions.
His face and voice were as a mirror that revealed with
microscopic exactness his innermost self. What he felt moved
to speak he spoke; what he felt urged to do he did; he never
stopped to consider whether it will please or displease, whether
it will bring praise or censure upon him. Like a piece of
living, weather-beaten New England granite he looked in his
home-spun crash blouse, his jean trousers girded at the waist
with a rope, his coarse woolen shirt open at the neck, his
well-worn bast shoes. He seemed, indeed, a composite of the
looks and traits and thoughts that characterized the Puritans
in the early history of the New England states.</p>

<p>He lived his life according to his own light. Excepting
God, he bowed to no master. His conscience was his sole
rule of right. His law was his own. His creed was his own.
His style of dress, his mode of living were of his own choosing.
His was above all else himself, not an echo of another.
He was the freest man in the most enslaved of lands. His
was the brightest mind in darkest Russia, the most democratic
spirit in the most autocratic of realms. His peasant garb
could not hide the noble man, ennobled by exalted thought
and achievement and not by the will of potentate. His
peasant labor could not hide the man born to command, not
by means of knout or sword or prison but by the law of love
and right and truth.</p>


<p class="is">As severe with the
world so gentle
with his own.</p>

<p>As fearless as he was in his denunciations of the wrong-doings
of government and church and society, and as bold as
he was in his reform propositions, so gentle and
simple-minded was he at his family table. I had
read that two kinds of meals were served at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
table, a frugal one for himself and a sumptuous one for the
rest of his family. The meal of which I partook was a frugal
one for all. I was, however, little conscious of what I ate.
I was held spell-bound by the count's conversation which
dominated the table, and which was carried on in English,
occasionally passing into German or French or Russian.</p>


<p class="is">A table incident.</p>

<p>He was in an especially happy mood that evening. In
the mail that had been brought to the table there were a
number of papers. Opening one of these, the
London <i>Standard</i>, I believe, he observed that an
article of his had been severely censored by the Russian
government. Large parts of it had been smeared over with
black ink. What amused him was that the parts that were
left uncensored were worse than those that had been blackened
out, revealing the stupidity of the censor. Turning to me,
who sat at his right, he said that had the article been a
panegyric on the Czar, it would probably have received the
same treatment, for no matter what he writes, it is daubed
over, here and there, on the general principle that, having
been written by Tolstoy, it must of necessity be revolutionary.
Continuing, he told me that that particular article was one of
a series on the subject of "<i>Christianity and Patriotism</i>," which,
not being permitted to be published in Russia, appeared in
translation in England. In it he endeavored to show that
Christianity and patriotism were incompatible, that the latter
was an artificial creation, skilfully nourished by rulers for
selfish purposes. On account of it wars are waged, evils are
wrought, sufferings are inflicted by Christians upon Christians,
who are <i>religiously</i> taught to love one another, to forgive one
another, to do good to each other, and who are <i>patriotically</i>
trained to hate and overreach each other. Humanity, he said,
must be put in the place of patriotism. The latter is both
stupid and unmoral, <i>stupid</i> because it leads each nation to
regard itself the superior of all others, and <i>unmoral</i> because it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
lures nations to possess themselves of advantages at the cost
of others, thus violating the fundamental law of morality,
that of not doing to others what they would not have others
do to them. Humanity makes the whole world every man's
country, and every man each man's brother.</p>


<p class="is">His home over-run
by visitors.</p>

<p>When first introduced to the family I felt that their welcome
was not quite as hearty as was that of the count. I
could easily understand the reason. The presence
of guests was almost a daily occurrence,
and quite a burden on the household. The count denied himself
to none who had a genuine purpose for seeking him. But
he was out of patience with mere curiosity seekers or newspaper
writers, who sought to rob him of his valuable time in
order to fill a column or two with sensational matter. One
such writer, a lady journalist, came one day for the sole purpose
of having him give her the menu of his vegetarian diet,
to tell her whether his undergarments were of as coarse a
fabric as were his outer clothes, and whether an equally
picturesque peasant-garb might not be designed for women.</p>


<p class="is">Special incident
wins for me
family's special
welcome.</p>

<p>My first impression that I was classed with the other
afflictions of the count's universal popularity soon wore off,
however, by reason of a letter to the family
which I brought with me from a distinguished
professor. This gentleman had, a short time
before, been dismissed from the university of St. Petersburg
because he had published an essay on <i>The Ethics of the Talmud</i>,
in which he had endeavored to show the lofty moral teachings
of the Jews. I had made his acquaintance while in St. Petersburg,
and before leaving that city he called on me, and asked
me whether I would not take a letter from him, of an entirely
uncompromising nature, to Tolstoy, inasmuch, as at that
particular time, a letter mailed to the count did not, for easily
accountable reasons, always reach him. I readily consented,
and that little service, the professor having been a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
favorite of the count, made me a welcome guest also to the
family.</p>


<p class="is">Approves of stand
taken to gain
admission.</p>

<p>Supper over, the count invited my companion and myself
to join him on a walk and to tell him of what service he could
be to me. I told him of the mission that brought
me to Russia and of the difficulties that were
placed in the way of my admission. He approved
of the stand I had taken, but asked me to blame the governments
for it, mine as well as his, and not the Russians, who
are a kindly people.</p>


<p class="is">If United States
would take bolder
stand Russia
would yield.</p>

<p>He entered at length upon an exposition showing that if
the United States would refuse to countenance discriminations
between her citizens on account of religious
belief, Russia would be obliged to yield. I told
him of the audience which Mr. White and myself
had had with M. Witte, and that the latter had said that, the
Czar being sick, nothing could be done without his consent,
that I should state my request in the form of a petition,
written in English and Russian, and that he would present it
to the Czar with his approval upon the latter's return, and
that I had complied with the advice given. The count had
little faith that my petition would ever reach the eyes of the
Czar&mdash;and it never did, for the Czar never returned alive. And
he had little faith in all official promises. The men in power
at that time he believed to be either fanatics or cowards. The
former sought to secure for themselves a soft berth in heaven,
the latter sought it on earth. These were afraid to speak out
their honest thought and to deal an honest blow for right and
justice. They were afraid of losing caste or position or of
being condemned to penal servitude, as if better persons than
they had not suffered martyrdom before, or were not now
paying in Siberia the price for exercising their right to liberty
of thought and speech.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">Approves of my
mission but has
little hope.</p>

<p>He warmly approved of my mission but saw no present
possibility of its realization. Even if the Czar were to feel
kindly disposed toward my plan, Pobiedonostzeff,
the Procurator of the Holy Synod, would interpose
his objections to permitting Jews rooting
themselves on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The policy of the Procurator, he said, was to root out the
Jews, to drive them either into the Greek Catholic Church or
into exile or starvation, stupidly attributing the evils of Russia
to her tolerance of non-orthodox-Christian faiths and seeing
relief only in their extinction within the empire. And that
miscreant considered himself the official head of the Russian
church, and the administrator of its creed in the name of Jesus,
of him who bade man to love even his enemy, to do good
even to those who do evil, to forgive even those who offend,
to bless even those who curse.</p>


<p class="is">Asks my attitude
toward Jesus, and
defines his.</p>

<p>Stopping suddenly, and turning his face full upon me, he
asked "What is your belief respecting Jesus?" I answered
that I regard the Rabbi of Nazareth as one of
the greatest of Israel's teachers and leaders and
reformers, not as a divine being who lived and
taught humanly but as a human being who lived and taught
divinely. "Such is my belief," said he, and he continued
"Your belief, however, is not that of the Jews in Russia.
Many of them have little knowledge of Jesus, and more of
them, I fear, have little love for him. And who can blame
them?" he continued, "they have been made to suffer so
much in his name that it would be little short of a miracle if
they loved him. Mohamed was more honest, he gave to
people the choice between the Koran and the sword. Christians
profess love, and practice hatred." I told the count
that through the mediation of Mr. White, the Procurator had
consented to grant me an audience, but not till after the lapse
of seven weeks, after his return from some monastery to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he had retired for prayer, penance and meditation. "Well
may he meditate," said the count, "on the wrongs he has
committed, and even were he to do penance seven times seven
weeks or seven times seven months or seven years, he could
not blot out the guilt that stains his soul, and that has darkened
and cursed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent human
beings."</p>


<p class="is">Tells why he escaped
Siberia.</p>

<p>Amazed at the freedom with which he exposed his condemnation
of the most powerful officials of the realm, and convinced
that as he spoke to me he must have
spoken often to others, and that the government
could not possibly be ignorant of it, I asked how it was that
he had escaped seizure, exile or imprisonment, to which he
replied: "I am not yet sure that I shall not end my days in
Siberia. That I have escaped thus far is due to the government's
sensitiveness of the world's opinion. It knows of the
hold my publications have gained for me on civilized people.
It fears the cry of outrage that would be raised at the banishment
or imprisonment of a man as old as I."</p>

<p>He was at that time sixty-six years old. I have since
read, that when the Czar was one day approached by one
of the grand dukes with a request for the banishment of
Tolstoy on the ground that he incited rebellion against the
government and the church, the Czar is said to have replied,
"<i>Je ne veux pas ajouter a sa gloire une couronne d' un martyr</i>"&mdash;<i>I
do not wish to add to his glory the martyr's crown</i>&mdash;words
used by Louis XIV of France, when a similar request was
made of him.</p>


<p class="is">Under the Poverty
Tree.</p>

<p>After that statement, he walked silently, lost in deep
thought, perhaps picturing to himself his declining days among
fellow martyrs in far-away Siberia, perhaps
thinking of the agonies and tortures and untimely
deaths that had been inflicted by a cruel or misguided government
on thousands of Russia's noblest sons and daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Silently he led the way toward a tree that stood near the
house, upon a slight eminence. It was the <i>Poverty Tree</i> that
was destined to afford him beneath its wide spreading branches
his last resting place. It derived its name from the custom of
poor peasants laying there their troubles before the count.
Seating himself on a bench beneath the tree he beckoned to
us to seat ourselves along side of him. He continued silent
for some time, while the setting sun bathed his lionine face
and hair in crimson and golden light, and gave him an appearance
not unlike one of the old Norse gods or vikings which
the artist's brush has made familiar to us. At last he resumed
his speech.</p>

<h2>My Visit to Tolstoy.<br />
<span class="medium">(<i>Continued.</i>)</span></h2>

<p class="center smcap">A Discourse, at Temple Keneseth Israel,<br />
by<br />
Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, D. D.</p>

<p class="center">Philadelphia, December 18th, 1910.</p>

<p class="i2 p2">[<span class="smcap">Resumé</span>&mdash;Discourse I: Reason for my visit to Russia and for my
calling on Tolstoy. Description of his appearance and personality. Some
of his views on Russia, its statesmen, its religion, its misgovernment.
A pause under <i>Poverty Tree</i> beneath which he now lies buried.]</p>


<p class="is">Tolstoy recalled
aid sent from
Philadelphia to
famine-stricken in
Russia.</p>

<p>The first question count Tolstoy put to me, after his long
silence, was from what part of the United States I hailed.
Upon my telling him that Philadelphia was my
home, he expressed himself as much pleased.
He recalled the two shiploads of food we sent
from our port, two years earlier, for the relief of
the famine-stricken of Russia, and of the distribution of which
he had had personal charge, and he spoke with pleasure and
appreciation of Mr. Francis B. Reeves, our fellow-townsman,
who had accompanied the food-relief.</p>


<p class="is">Said first aid came
from Sacramento
synagogue.</p>

<p>With even keener delight he recalled that the first aid
received from the United States was from the Jewish congregation
of Sacramento, California, which to him
was all the more remarkable from the fact that
the district stricken was, through governmental
restriction, uninhabited by Jews. The expression of pleasure
turned to one of sorrow when he remarked that Russia had
little deserved such generous treatment at the hands of Jews,&mdash;and
he lived to see the manner in which it was repaid in
Kishineff and other places.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">Was fond of
Quakers.</p>

<p>Reverting to our city, he said that the name of Philadelphia
had always had a pleasant sound for him, partly
because of its meaning "<i>Brotherly Love</i>," and
partly because it was founded by William Penn.
He expressed a high admiration for Quakers, and asked how
strong they were numerically and whether they are still as
opposed to war and resistance as their founders were. Upon
answering his question to the best of my ability, he asked:
"Why is it that war, which is the greatest curse of mankind,
has so many advocates, and peace, the greatest of all blessings,
so few?" After some discussion we both agreed that it
was due to that strange perversity of human nature that sees
the right and approves of it, and yet often willfully chooses
the wrong.</p>


<p class="is">Blamed school for
many of present-day
wrongs.</p>

<p>He blamed the schools for many of the errors that obtain
in society, and claimed that there was too much education of
the wrong kind, and too little of the right. In
discussing this statement of his, I chanced to
mention that education in the lower grades was
compulsory with us. To this he strongly objected. All compulsion,
he said, was wrong. Man must be gotten to do right
by the law of love and not by the rule of force. Upon my
telling him that but for compulsory education some parents
would never send their children to school, he said: "What of
it? The children would probably be no less moral and no less
happy than those of highest education. I have associated
with the learned and the ignorant, and I have found more
honor and honesty, more fear of the Lord and more true
happiness, among the unlettered than among the lettered.
The more of education we cram into the heads of the people
the more of the fear of God is crowded out of them. The
world lives by the love of God and not by the primer or
the multiplication table." "What, if you had had no education?"
I ventured to ask. Quickly and feelingly came the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
answer "The world would have been none the worse, and
I would have been the happier." "What if Jesus and the
other prophets had had no schooling?" I asked. To which
he replied "It was not what they got out of their schools that
made them the spiritual and moral powers they became, but
what they got out of their hearts. God puts more education
into the human heart than man has ever been able to put into
the head. Some of the wisest and best people hereabouts are
peasants who have never seen the inside of a school, and who
do not know one letter from another." "What of Paul,"
I asked, "who certainly enjoyed the benefits of the Greek
schools of his day?" To which he replied "The schools
made of Paul a theologian, and Christianity would have been
the better without the theology of Paul."</p>


<p class="is">Warped by unfavorable
surroundings.</p>

<p>Other objections to some of his paradoxical views on
education suggested themselves to me, but I left them unsaid.
I perceived that while tolerant of objections, his
opinions were fixed. He apparently judged of
world-conditions from the view-point of his
limited and unfavorable horizon. Under different conditions,
some of his opinions on education, and on a number of other
subjects which we discussed, would probably have been quite
different.</p>


<p class="is">Well informed of
political and social
conditions in
United States.</p>

<p>The conversation turned to social conditions in the United
States, and on these matters he displayed an amount of knowledge
that was amazing. The more I listened
the more I wondered, till finally I could not but
ask him how he who wrote and worked so much
could find time to keep himself so well informed of a country
so far away as the United States. To which he replied "Your
country has interested me even more than mine. I have lost
hope in mine; all my hope was, at one time, centered in yours.
But yours is a disappointment as much as mine. You call
yourselves a Republic; you are worse than an autocracy. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
say worse because you are ruled by gold, and gold is more
conscienceless, and therefore, more tyrannical than any human
tyrant. Your intentions are good; your execution is lamentable.
Were yours the free and representative government
you pretend to have, you would not allow it to be controlled
by the money powers and their hirelings, the bosses and
machines, as you do. I have read <i>Progress and Poverty</i> by
Henry George, and I know what Mr. Bryce says about you in
his <i>The American Commonwealth</i>, and I have read and heard
even worse things about your misgovernment than what they
say."</p>


<p class="is">Deplored rule of
gold and growth
of cities.</p>

<p>We were all right, he continued, as long as we were
an agricultural people. Our modes of life, then, were simple,
and our ideals were high. Politics then was a
religion with us and not a matter of barter and
sale. We became prosperous; prosperity brought
luxury, and luxury, as always, brings corruption. The thirst
of gold is upon us, and, in our eagerness to quench it and to
gratify our lust of luxury, our one-time lofty principles and
aspirations are dragged down and trampled in the mire. We
build city upon city, and pride ourselves in making one greater
than the other, and, in the mean time, we wipe out village
after village, whence have come our strength and moral fibre.
The price of real estate in the cities is soaring to the skies,
while farms are deserted and farm-houses decay. We tempt
the farmer's son and daughter from field to factory, and when
we have exhausted them of their health and morals we think
ourselves charitable when we prolong their miserable existence
in hospitals or reformatories. We forget that our greatness
lay in the pursuit of husbandry, and we seek our salvation in
commerce and in the industries.</p>


<p class="is">Prophesied war
of classes.</p>

<p>With all our stupendous wealth, our slums are as bad, if
not worse, as those of European cities, and we are building
up a proletariat class which will some day prove
our undoing. Our rich become degenerates, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
our poor become desperates, and in the struggle to come the
desperate will rise up and slay the degenerate. We keep
things quiet by throwing crumbs of charity to those who are
in need of justice more yet than they are in need of bread.
Some day they will tire of crumbs, and will ask their full
share of what the rich eat and have, and, if denied, they will
make short work of it. Our origin and our destiny should
have warned us against repeating the fatal errors of the past.
But for our colossal resources, we would long since have been
dashed against the rocks. We may yet save ourselves by
going back to the farm, and taking up anew the life and
labors of our fathers.</p>


<p class="is">Disagreed,
yet kept silent.</p>

<p>In this strain he continued for quite awhile, and the
longer he spoke the sadder grew his speech and the more
prophetic became his look. At length he ceased
speaking, and an oppressive quiet ensued. I
recognized that he was deeply moved, and I therefore did not
care to contradict some of his statements which were obviously
based on error. In other of his statements I fully agreed with
him, yet, loyalty to my country forbade my seconding the
gloomy prospect he held out for us.</p>


<p class="is">Description of his
relationship with
wife and family.</p>

<p>A fortunate interruption relieved the situation. His wife
approached with a letter or manuscript in hand. He arose,
proceeded toward her, and, for a while, the two
conferred together. In all probability it was a
manuscript of his which she was translating or
revising. I was told that she was always doing something
of that sort. She was his consultant, his reviser, his translator,
while his daughter, Tatiana, was his correspondent in a
number of different languages. It is said that his wife copied
twenty-one times the four large volumes of his novel <i>War and
Peace</i>, and that there has been no novel nor little else of his
writing, since their marriage in 1862, that did not pass
through her hands. He found in her, in the fullest sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the word, his help-mate, a woman of great culture as well of
great practical sense, who looked after his literary interests
no less than after those of the household, and who often found
it no easy task to be, as has been well said, "the patient wife
of an impatient genius." She bore him thirteen children, six
of whom passed away in their early youth. She fairly idolized
him and skilfully managed to slip, unknown to him, those
little comforts into his life which he required for his well-being
and which he had renounced. Neither she nor the children
shared his view respecting the distribution among the peasantry
of his estate and other property, and keeping for himself no
more than an equal share with all the others. The family
believed in availing themselves of the benefits of civilization,
and for that they required the income of the farm and the
royalty of his books. There was quite a wrangle, for a time,
between the family and its head, but it was amicably disposed
of in the end, the count agreeing to their living as they chose,
on the condition that they permitted him to live as he pleased.
And so in his Moscow home as well as in that at Yasnaya
Polyana, while the family rooms are said to be comfortably
furnished, his own were poorly fitted out, and while they have
servants and butlers and footmen, he attended to his own
wants, fetched his own water, cobbled his own shoes, and, in
summer time, labored in the field, from morn to night, alongside
the commonest peasant.</p>


<p class="is">Description of his
working room.</p>

<p>Stopping suddenly in his conversation with his wife, and
begging us to excuse him for leaving us, I asked him whether
he knew where my bag was put, as I wanted to
get to my writing material for the purpose of
dropping a line to the American Minister. Mr. White had
feared that, not being wanted in Russia, I might get into
trouble soon after leaving the protection of our embassy in
St. Petersburg, and he had enjoined upon me that I keep in
constant touch with him, as well as with the American consuls,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
while in the interior. The count informing me that my bag
had been placed into his working-room, on the ground floor
of the house, I had a glimpse of the room in which some of
the greatest writings of our time, of all times, first saw the
light of day. It was a small room with an ordinary, bare
floor somewhat the worse for wear, with a vaulted ceiling,
and with very thick walls that gave it the aspect of a mediaeval
cloister cell. I have since read that at one time it was a storeroom,
and that from the hooks in the ceiling were formerly
suspended the ham supply for the family. Besides a crude
writing-desk and a few chairs, there seemed to be no other
furniture in the room, and its only ornaments, as far as I can
recall, were some farm implements, tools, and seed bags.
The desk was littered over with books and papers, and showed
the kind of disorder one would expect of a genius like
Tolstoy.</p>


<p class="is">Favored suppression
of lawyers.</p>

<p>Upon my return to the tree, I found the count in conversation
with my companion, who told me later that upon
Tolstoy's asking him what his occupation was,
and upon his replying that he had graduated
from the law-school of the University of Moscow, and that,
owing to restrictive laws against Jews, he was not permitted
to practice, the count had remarked that the government had
done at least one good thing, it had diminished the number of
lawyers.</p>


<p class="is">Amazed at the
amount of poverty
in New York.</p>

<p>Resuming my seat alongside of him, he asked me whether
it was true that New York expended as much as one hundred
thousand dollars daily in public charity. I told
him that it probably was true. He then returned
to his discussion on the appalling contrast between
the very rich and the very poor of the large cities in
Europe and America. The rich, he said, would never be as
rich as they are nor the poor as poor if the latter were scattered
as farmers over the land. It is their congregating in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
large numbers in the cities, he said, that makes possible the
extensive industries and commercial enterprises which enslave
them, and which build up the great fortunes of the rich.</p>


<p class="is">Belittled his own
novels.</p>

<p>"Have you read my book <i>What To Do</i>?" he suddenly
asked me. I was obliged to answer "No." I have read it
since, and several times, and profitably, too, but,
though I had read quite a number of his books
before I met him, it was exceedingly embarrassing to be questioned
concerning the particular book which I had not read.
Not to appear altogether ignorant of his writings, I proceeded
to tell him that I had read his "War and Peace," "Anna Karénina,"
etc., etc., and started telling him how much I admired
them, when, with an impatient look and gesture, he interrupted
me, saying "These works are all chaff, chaff, play-toys, amusing
gilded youth and idle women. It is my serious writings
which I want the world to read. I have ceased publishing
novels because readers do not know the meaning of them.
They look for entertainment and not instruction, and even
though I write only for the uplift of man, for the purification
of society, they, like the hawk, seek out only the carrion.
They neither recognize themselves under the fictitious name
I adopt, nor do they see their share in the wrongs and vices
and injustices depicted, neither do they perceive that it is for
their co-operation that the novelist appeals when he pleads for
the kingdom of heaven on earth."</p>


<p class="is">Spoke of his book
<i>What To Do</i>.</p>

<p>Returning to his book <i>What To Do</i>, he said, "even if you
have not read it, you have read the Prophets, and having read
them, you know my teachings. The book is an
appeal for pity for the submerged, for justice for
the wronged, for liberation of the oppressed and persecuted,
and for the application of the only remedy&mdash;a return to the
simple life and labor on the soil. As our subsistence comes
from the soil so can justice and right and happiness come from
it alone. Help can never come from wealth, for wealth is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
creator of poverty and inequality and injustice. It can not
come from the government for that exists largely for the purpose
of keeping up inequality and injustice. It cannot come
from the church, for she fears the Czar more than she fears
God. It cannot even come from the schools which tend to
train a class of people who think themselves too good for
manual labor."</p>


<p class="is">Saw solution of
Jewish problem
only in agriculture.</p>

<p>"Your plan to lead your people back to the soil," he
continued, "back to the occupation which your fathers followed
with honor in Palestinian lands, is of some
encouragement to me. It shows that the light
is dawning. It is the only solution of the Jewish
problem. Persecution, refusal of the right to own or to till
the soil, exclusion from the artisan guilds, made traders
of the Jew. And the world hates the trader. Make bread-producers
of your people, and the world will honor those who
give it bread to it."</p>


<p class="is">Made a request
of me.</p>

<p>"There is little chance at present," he continued, "for a
Jewish colonization scheme in Russia. The government does
not want to see the Jews rooting themselves on
Russian soil, and spreads the report that they
are unfit for agricultural labor, though I have been reliably
informed that in the few Jewish agricultural colonies that
have been tolerated on the steppes from the time of Alexander I
they are as successful farmers as are the best." And he
asked me as a favor that I make a special trip to those colonies
and report to him, preferably in person, the result of my
observations. I was only too anxious to consent to his
request.</p>

<p>And yet another promise he asked of me, and which I
gave no less cheerfully. But of this I shall speak in my next
discourse.</p>

<h2>My Visit to Tolstoy.<br />
<span class="medium">(<i>Continued.</i>)</span></h2>

<p class="smcap center">A Discourse, at Temple Keneseth Israel,<br />
by<br />
Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, D. D.</p>

<p class="center">Philadelphia, December 25th, 1910.</p>


<p class="i2 p2"><span class="smcap">Resumé</span>&mdash;<i>Discourse I</i>: Reasons for my visit to Russia and for my
calling on Tolstoy. His appearance and personality. Some of his views
on Russia, its statesmen, religion, misgovernment. A pause under the
Poverty Tree&mdash;his burial place.</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Discourse II</i>: Recalled food-relief for famine-stricken in Russia
from Philadelphia and from Jewish congregation in California. Admired
Quakers for their opposition to war. Blamed schools for many social
wrongs. Severely criticised political and economical evils of our country.
Ascribed them to growth of cities and to farm-desertions. His relationship

his novels. Spoke of his book <i>What To Do?</i> Saw solution of
Jewish problem in agriculture only.</p>


<p class="is">Tolstoy suggests
school for training
American lads in
agriculture.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of my last discourse I made mention
of yet another request count Tolstoy made of me. It was in
connection with his prediction that the Russian
government would not look favorably upon my
proposition to colonize Russian Jews upon unoccupied
farm-lands in the interior. "If the plan cannot be
entered upon in Russia," he asked, "why can it not be made
successful in the United States? What are you, Americans,
doing to prevent a Jewish problem in your own country?
How long before the evils that are harrowing your people in
the old world may be harrowing them in the new? Your
people are crowding into your large cities by the thousands
and tens of thousands. You have built up Ghettoes worse
than those of Europe. There is excuse for it in Russia; there
is no excuse for it in the United States. Yours is the right to
own land and the best of it, and to till as much of it as you
please. Granted that ages of enforced abstention from agricultural
labor have weaned the elder generation from a love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of country life and farm-labor, why may not a love for it be
instilled in the young? Lead your young people to the
country and to the farm. Start agricultural schools for them.
Teach them to exchange the yard-stick for the hoe, the
peddler's pack for the seed-bag, and you will solve the problem
while it may yet be solved. You will see the lands tilled by
them overflow, as of old, with milk and honey. You will see
them give of their plenty to the people of the land, and receive
in return goodly profit and esteem. And once again there
will arise from among Jewish husbandmen prophets, lawgivers,
inspired bards and teachers to whom the civilized world will
do homage."</p>

<p>At yet greater length he spoke on this subject, and the
more he spoke the more he quickened within me the resolve
to do as he wished it to be done.</p>


<p class="is">Founding of Farm
School promised.</p>

<p>And there, under <i>The Poverty Tree</i>, it was where I gave
Tolstoy the solemn promise that upon my return home the
earliest task I would enter upon would be the
establishment of an agricultural school for Jewish
lads, and other lads. And the existence of the <i>National Farm
School</i>, near Doylestown in this state, is testimony that I kept
my promise. I had gone to Russia to see the Czar, and I saw
a greater man instead. I had gone with a plan for colonizing
Russian Jews in Russia, and I returned with a plan for teaching
agriculture chiefly to Russian Jewish lads in the United
States. Verily, "man proposes and God disposes." And the
hundreds of young men who have received their agricultural
training at the National Farm School, and the hundreds of
others, young and old, who, directly and indirectly, have been
encouraged by that school to forsake the congested cities and
to take up the farmer's life, owe their escape from the miseries
of the Ghetto, and their enjoyment of health and happiness,
to the promise asked of me by that noblest of all farmers,
count Tolstoy.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">Promise kept
under difficulties.</p>

<p>The establishment of the school was not an easy task, nor
is its maintenance easy even now, notwithstanding the excellent
record it has made. The bulk of our people
have not yet acquired that profound grasp of the
seriousness of our problem, and of its only possible solution,
that Tolstoy had, sixteen years ago. Therefore is the support
of that school still so meagre. Therefore has it still less than
a hundred students in attendance when it easily could have a
thousand, and more, if it had the means. And, therefore, are
our Ghettoes more crowded than ever, and a greater drain
than ever on our charities. That despite indifference and even
hostility the school has persevered is due, to a very large
extent, to the determination to keep sacred a promise solemnly
given to one of the best of men.</p>


<p class="is">Parting from
Tolstoy.</p>

<p>It was late that night when I took leave of the count and
of some of the members of his family. Before departing, it
was agreed that I enter at once upon my journey
to the Jewish agricultural colonies in the interior,
that I might see them at work during the height of their
harvesting, and a peasant and his wagon were engaged to
take me on that trip. The count bade me a hearty God-speed,
and repeatedly urged me to make my report personally to him,
and I promised that I would avail myself a second time of his
proffered hospitality, if my way should lead me back again to
Moscow or St. Petersburg.</p>


<p class="is">Never heard from
him again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after my inspection of the Jewish agricultural
colonies, which fully confirmed the favorable reports the
count had received of them, my investigations
led me to the Southern and Polish provinces,
and consumed so much of my limited time that a return North
was impossible. And so I never got to see the count again.
And I never heard from him. Neither my report, which I
sent to him in writing, nor my other communications to him,
written in Russia and outside of it, have brought from him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
reply. Never a line from him even in answer to the information
sent him that the National Farm School, which he had so
strongly urged, had been founded. Never an acknowledgment
from him of the early annual reports of the School that were
sent him to show the headway it was making.</p>


<p class="is">Probable reason
of silence.</p>

<p>The heartiness of his reception of me, his almost affectionate
farewell, his deep interest in my mission and his
earnest invitation that I repeat my visit to him,
preclude the thought that I was forgotten by
him or became indifferent to him after my departure. There
is but one explanation&mdash;an explanation strengthened by
similar experiences of others in connection with him&mdash;none
of my communications ever reached him. I was not wanted
in Russia. I was a <i>persona non grata</i> to the government; my
name was blacklisted, and my mail fell under the ban of the
censor.</p>


<p class="is">With him in spirit
under Poverty Tree.</p>

<p>But, if my mail has never reached him, my thoughts have
been with him often. Many a time have I sat with him, in
spirit, under that <i>Poverty Tree</i>. And yet more
often will I sit with him there in the future, now
that that site has become <i>Holy Ground</i>.</p>


<p class="is">Has become his
grave.</p>

<p>Gladly do I forgive the church of Russia many an outrage
or blunder she has perpetrated or permitted to be perpetrated,
for the one good act she has performed&mdash;that of
refusing Tolstoy sepulture in what she is pleased
to call "consecrated ground." She thus obliged him to designate
as his last resting-place a spot that was one of the dearest
on earth to him, a spot that was intimately associated with
his life's philosophy, a spot located within a confine wherein
he ruled more mightily and more exaltedly than any Czar that
ever wielded scepter in vast Russia, where he wrote those
epochal books of his which are destined some day to become
of the basal elements of the religion of the future.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">No Czarian funeral
more solemn than
Tolstoy's.</p>

<p>And even though no priest was nigh when the last rites
over his remains were performed, there were present, besides
his family, those who were more sacred in his
eyes than priests or metropolitan, more honorable
than even the Procurator of the Holy Synod&mdash;his
dearly beloved peasants. It was these who followed him
to his last resting place. It was these who sang the mortuary
hymn <i>Everlasting Memory</i>, at his open grave. It was these,
the "orphaned peasantry," as they called themselves because
of his death, who gave his burial a distinction such as no
Czarian funeral procession had ever enjoyed, notwithstanding
ecclesiastical pomp or military display. It was these whose
labors and outlook he had sought to soften and to brighten,
who delivered the briefest and most eloquent eulogy that has,
perhaps, ever been spoken: "<i>His heart has burst because of his
unbounded love for humanity. The light of the world is extinguished.</i>"</p>


<p class="is">In spite of herself
church has made
a saint of him.</p>

<p>In refusing religious sepulture to the holiest man in
Russia, the Greek orthodox church performed the crowning
feat in her long series of stupidities. And yet,
by that act she did, in despite of herself, the
very thing she did not wish to see done. Like
Mephistopheles in Goethe's <i>Faust</i> who, in response to the
question who he is, says: "<i>Ich bin ein Theil von jener Kraft,
die stets das Böse will, und stets das Gute schafft</i>," so did she
prove herself the power that sought the evil and yet performed
the good. By her act of intolerance she gave a new saint to
Russia, and perhaps the only one she has. By it she furnished
a sanctuary to that country, one that may be destined to make
a Mecca of Yasnaya Polyana, one that may be more piously
sought in the future, and by larger numbers, than any shrine
or sanctuary of her own creation. By that act she shed a halo
of immortal glory around the head of him whom she sought
to cover with infamy.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">Has two ways of
making saints.</p>

<p>The church has two ways of conferring saintships, a lesser
and a higher one. The lesser distinction she confers upon
lesser luminaries, generally upon those made famous
by myth or legend for great endurance in
fasting or penance, or for conquering imaginary devils, for
working fancied miracles, or for displaying fiendish cruelty in
persecuting and exterminating heretics. The higher distinction
she confers generally at the stake or on the gallows,
within prison walls or in the torture chamber, upon men of
great minds or great hearts, upon lovers of truth and fearless
enunciators of it, upon men who because of their love of
humanity defy the power that interdicts God's greatest gift
to man: the right to think and the right to believe and speak
in accordance with the canons of reason and with the dictates
of conscience.</p>


<p class="is">Still makes of intolerance
an act
of piety.</p>

<p>In asking me the difference between reform and orthodox
Judaism in America, and between American Reform Jews and
Russian Karaitic Jews, and in replying that the
difference exists mainly in the synagogue, that
outside of it there is little or no difference in life
and in social relationship, Tolstoy replied: "Our church has
not yet arrived at the stage of tolerance of different religious
beliefs. That is the reason why such people as the Jews and
Doukhobors and Stundists are persecuted, and such men as I
are in ill repute. Our church still makes of religious hatred an
act of piety. It still measures God by the passions of man.
Had the church the power in our days which it at one time had,
and were the age of martyrdom not past, she would long since
have silenced me for rebelling against her irrational teaching and
for denouncing her craven supineness in the midst of outrageous
wrongs and injustices, as now they silence men in our country
for rebelling against unjust enactments of the government."</p>


<p class="is">Tolstoy hoped for
the reign of universal
good-will.</p>

<p>Upon my saying that it was fortunate for us of the present
day that all churches have been deprived of their one-time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
all-controlling power, since no church has yet
been known to have possessed power and not to
have abused it, he replied: "That is true of all
power, temporal as well as of ecclesiastic, and it would be
more fortunate still if governments were as restricted in their
power as is the church, if all power, all authority, were to
cease, if the good that is inherent in every human being were
to be given a chance to germinate and to flourish, and every
man learn to live in complete harmony with the highest of all
laws, the law of peace and good-will, which God has written
into the human heart. There would then be no need of
armies and armaments, of courts and police, of prisons and jails,
no need of impoverishing the masses through heavy taxation
for the support of millions of soldiers and officers in idleness,
who ought to raise their own bread by their own handiwork."</p>


<p class="is">Believed that the
Messiah is still to
come.</p>

<p>"On that day," said I, "the Messianic Age, for which
the Jews have hoped and prayed, will surely have dawned."
To which he answered: "You, Jews, are right,
the Messiah is still to come, or, if he has come, his
message has not yet entered the hearts of men."</p>

<p>Recalling this remark of Tolstoy, on this Christmas morn,
suggests the question: How many Christmas days will yet
have to come and go before its gospel of peace and good-will
will govern the hearts of all who call themselves Christians as
it governed that of the Russian peasant-saint.</p>


<p class="is">Lessening of
church power
shown by failure of
Tolstoy's excommunication.</p>

<p>And vividly I recalled his remarks on the shorn power of
the church, when, six years later, the papers brought the
news that Tolstoy had been excommunicated by
the Russian church. I could picture to myself
the expression of sorrow or disgust on his face
when that church decree was conveyed to him.
Its ecclesiastical wrath, could have meant only hollow sounds
to him. None knew better than he that the metropolitans
who issued this excommunication merely grasped at a shadow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that the substance was gone, that that age was happily passed
when the pronouncement of the ecclesiastical <i>anathema</i> deprived
its victim of all association with friend or foe, deprived
him of intercourse even with the closest members of his family,
prevented them, under the penalty of like punishment, from
providing him even with food, shelter and raiment. When
during his flight from home, shortly before his death, he
knocked at the doors of a monastery, and said "I am the
excommunicated and anathematized Leo Tolstoy," the reply
was "It is a duty and a pleasure to offer you shelter." The
life of Tolstoy passed on as serenely, in the midst of his family
and friends, after his excommunication as before. And the
world's esteem of him grew even greater than it had been, by
reason of the charges upon which the excommunication was
based, namely:</p>

<p class="i2">"In his writings on religious questions he clearly shows himself an
enemy of the Russian Orthodox Church. He does not recognize God in
three persons (or three persons in one God), and he calls the Son of God,
the second person of the Trinity, a mortal human being. He scoffs at
the idea of Incarnation. He perverts the text of the Gospel. He censures
the Holy Church and calls it a human institution. He denies the
Church Hierarchy and ridicules the Holy Sacraments and the rites of the
Holy Orthodox Church. Therefore, the Holy Synod has decreed that no
priest is to absolve Count Tolstoy, or give him communion. Nor is he to
be given burial ground, unless, before departing this life he shall repent,
acknowledge the Orthodox Church, believe in it, and return to it."</p>


<p class="is">Died unreconciled
with church.</p>

<p>He never recanted. He never changed his attitude towards
the errors and wrongs of the Russian orthodox church.
And no one who ever stood and talked with him,
face to face, could ever have believed that that
modern Prometheus, that stern and fearless personality,
that re-incarnation of Mattathias of old, and of his valiant
sons, the Maccabees, could ever swerve from a position once
taken by him. When upon his death-bed, he was frequently
importuned to return as a penitent to the mother-church; he
spurned every mention of it. He was still in the possession
of his senses, he said, he still knew and believed that twice two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
equals four, and as long as he knew and believed this so long
would he continue to know and to believe that what he had
said and written concerning the errors and wrongs of the
church was the truth.</p>


<p class="is">Never a truer follower
of Jesus than
he.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy, and quite in keeping with the general
tenor of the Russian orthodox church, that no cognizance was
taken by the church of the many noble things
Tolstoy had said and written and done; no
cognizance of the self-sacrificing efforts he had
made to live the life which Jesus had lived and had enjoined
upon his followers; no cognizance of his having conscientiously
endeavored to square his life with the teachings of the <i>Sermon
on the Mount</i>; no cognizance of his having brought light to
those in darkness and comfort to those in sorrow, of his having
consorted and labored with the poor and lightened their
burden, of his having thirsted and hungered after righteousness,
of his having sought peace and protested against war,
and preached the gospel of the wrongfulness of all physical
resistance, of his having, though of the oldest nobility,
spurned luxury and ease and even money, having regarded
these the source of corruption and the root of many of the
evils in society.</p>


<p class="is">Yet refused Christian
burial.</p>

<p>Such a person, and one even but half as good as this,
should have been entitled to sepulture in the most sacred of
Christian cemeteries, and the most eminent of
priests should have deemed it a privilege to have
been permitted to perform the last rites over his mortal
remains. So would it have happened among rational people,
but so could it not have happened in Russia. There, because
he could not subscribe to doctrines and rites and ceremonies
for which he found neither scriptural nor rational warrant,
priests felt themselves disgraced, and in danger of eternal
damnation, even when their names were associated with that
of Tolstoy.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">Priest objected to
his name being
associated with
Tolstoy's.</p>

<p>A striking illustration of this was given, seven years ago,
at the university of Dorpat, at the occasion of the celebration
of its hundredth anniversary. In commemoration
of that event the institution elected as honorary
members of the corporation a number of
Russians distinguished in literature, science and art, one of
these was Tolstoy, another was Ivan, the miracle-working
priest of Cronstadt, elected to allay the church's indignation
at the choice of Tolstoy. Ivan, the priest, refused the honor,
and in the following letter to the Rector of the University:</p>


<p class="i2">"<span class="smcap">Your Excellency</span>&mdash;I have read your estimable and respectful
letter to me, which is so full of subtle delicacy&mdash;I decline absolutely the
honor of the membership to which I have been elected. I do not wish to
become connected, in any way, with a corporation&mdash;however respectable
and learned&mdash;which, by some lamentable misunderstanding, has put me
side by side with that atheist Leo Tolstoy&mdash;the most malignant heretic of
our unfortunate age&mdash;who, in presumption and arrogance, surpasses all
previous heretics of any age. I do not wish to stand beside Antichrist.
I am surprised furthermore, to see with what indifference the University
Council regards that satanic author, and with what slavishness it burns
incense to him."</p>



<p class="i4">IVAN SERGEIEF,<br />
<i>Prior and Archpriest of the Cronstadt Cathedral</i>.</p>

<p>This letter tells of the attitude of the church towards
Tolstoy better than any words of mine can tell. And this
same Ivan, it is said, approved of the massacre of the petitioners
of St. Petersburg on that memorable White Sunday, and
when petitioned to protect the Jews against threatening
massacres, treated the appeal with silent contempt.</p>


<p class="is">Government hatred
back of that of the
church.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, however, that over and back of the
Church of Russia stands the government. The Czar is the
head of the church. Whom the government
favors the church favors; whom the government
hates, the church hates. The church hated Tolstoy
because the government hated him, and why it hated him
we shall be told in the next discourse of this series.</p>

<h2>My Visit to Tolstoy.<br />
<span class="medium">(<i>Continued.</i>)</span></h2>

<p class="smcap center">A Discourse, at Temple Keneseth Israel,<br />
by<br />
Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, D. D.</p>

<p class="center">Philadelphia, January 1st, 1911.</p>


<p class="is">Government used
church for discrediting
Tolstoy.</p>

<p>Speaking in our last discourse of the church's excommunication
of Tolstoy, and of its refusing a resting place to his
remains in what she calls "consecrated ground,"
we said that the Czar is the spiritual as well as
the temporal head of the Church of Russia, and
that the hated of the church is yet more the hated of the
government. This statement explains what otherwise is difficult
to understand, namely, how so good a man as Tolstoy,
who, for more than two score years, strove to square his life
with the teachings of the <i>Sermon on the Mount</i>, could have
incurred the hatred of the Russian orthodox Church. The
government had far more reason to hate Tolstoy than had the
church. Finding it impolitic to proceed directly against him,
it availed itself of the church for discrediting Tolstoy in the
eyes of the credulous populace.</p>


<p class="is">Before giving
reason why.</p>

<p>Before entering upon a discussion as to why the government
feared Tolstoy, we must first have a glimpse of his earlier
years, and briefly follow his heroic self-extrication
from the corruption of the aristocratic society
into which he was born, and his gradual rise to the exalted
station of greatest reformer in the history of Russia.</p>


<p class="is">Must hear story of
his life.</p>

<p>He was born eighty-two years ago of an ancient noble
family. His childhood years were spent in the midst of the
gay military life of Moscow. Yet more gay and
more corrupt was the society that surrounded
him during his university life. Experiencing a revulsion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
feeling against the kind of life he was leading, he fled from
the university before graduation, returned to his family estate
at Yasnaya Polyana and took up the life of a farmer.</p>

<p>This impetuous flight, and a later one of which we shall
hear presently, may throw some light upon his last flight, a
few weeks ago, which came to a pathetic end, and of which
we shall speak in our next discourse.</p>


<p class="is">His early glory and
shame.</p>

<p>Five years long he lived the life of a peasant, when a
call to arms landed him on the battlefields of the Crimea,
where he soon won distinction for heroic service.
But the dissoluteness of campaign-life soon disclosed
that the Tartar in him was not yet dead. He returned
to the debaucheries of his former years, and, according to his
own confession, with all the greater zest, because of the double
glory that had come to him, that of a distinguished soldier
and of a brilliant author. He had taken to story-writing, and
displayed in it a talent that made success instantaneous. He
became the lion of his day, and was courted by high and low.
And the greater his glory the more unrestrained grew his
libertinism.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="is">His reform.</p>

<p>But there were lucid intervals, now and then, during
which he held up to himself the lofty ideals of his former
peasant life, and bitterly he denounced himself,
and even portrayed himself unsparingly in the
character-sketches of some of his novels. His better self
acquired mastery at last; he threw off the yoke that had held
him fast to the corrupt society of his day, and for the second
time he fled to his estate.</p>

<p>He himself told of the circumstance that led to that flight.
He had attended a ball at the home of a prominent nobleman,
and passed the night in dancing and feasting, leaving his
peasant-coachman waiting for him outside, in an open sleigh,
in a bitter cold night. When at four in the morning he wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to return home, he found the coachman seemingly frozen
dead, and it required several hours of strenuous effort to
restore him to consciousness and to save his life. "Why,"
he asked himself, "should I, a rich, young aristocrat, who
has done nothing for society, spend the night amid warmth
and luxuries and feastings, while this peasant who represents
the class that has built our cities, given us our food and clothing
and other necessities, be kept outside to freeze?" He
resolved, then and there, to dedicate the remainder of his life
to the righting of this and other wrongs. And he kept his
promise.</p>

<p>How strong an impression this incident made upon him
may be gathered from an indirect allusion to it, in his novel
"<i>Master and Man</i>," published some two score years later.</p>


<p class="is">Consecrates life
to peasant.</p>

<p>It was discouraging work at first. The people whom he
desired to benefit had no faith in him. They could not conceive
of an aristocrat, to whom the serfs had been
no more than worms to be trod upon, becoming
suddenly interested in their welfare. There were long spells
of utter disheartenment. A number of times he found himself
at the brink of suicide. He sought relief and diversion in
travel, but returned more convinced than ever of the corruptions
and evils of society, of the tyranny of the classes and of
the sufferings of the masses.</p>

<p>Marriage opened at last a new vista of life to him. Aided
and stimulated by his cultured and companionable wife he
entered upon his reform work by directing a powerful search-light
on the goings-on among the high and the low, in a
series of novels that secured for him at once rank among the
greatest novelists of his age.</p>


<p class="is">Aided by his
writings.</p>

<p>In the second discourse of this series, I spoke of his having
deprecated his novels, and of his having expressed his preference
for his ethical and religious and sociological
and economical and political writings. I ven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>tured
to say to him that but for his novels he would have
gotten but comparatively few people to look into his other
writings, that his fiction had secured a world-wide audience,
that they contained many of the teachings of his other books,
and that the public swallows a moral pill easiest when offered
in the form of a novel. To which he replied "Most readers
swallow the sugar-coating and leave the pill untouched, or, if
they swallow it, it remains unassimilated."</p>

<p class="is">His novels
criticized.</p>

<p>And he was right. I have heard much criticism of Tolstoy's
novels. Some find him too realistic, too plain spoken,
even coarse. A certain magazine that had begun
publishing his "<i>Resurrection</i>" was obliged to
discontinue the story, because of complaints by many of its
readers. It was a sad commentary, not on the morals of the
writer but on the lack of morals, or on the false modesty, of
the readers, for that novel has been declared by eminent critics
to be "the greatest and most moral novel ever written."
Others again value his realism for whatever spice they might
find therein, little heeding the serious purpose for which the
story was written.</p>

<p class="is">Few know meaning
of novel in Russia.</p>

<p>At best, few people understand the meaning of a novel in
such a country as Russia, where free press, free pulpit, free platform
and free speech are unknown, where the
novelist attempts to do the work of all of these,
under the guise of fiction, the only form of literature that has
a chance to pass the eye of the censor. Whole systems of political
and social and moral reform are crowded between the
covers of a novel, which, if published in any other form of
literature, would condemn the author to life-long imprisonment
in the Siberian mines. The novelist in Russia does not
look upon himself as an entertainer nor as a money-maker,
neither is he looked upon as such. He is the prophet, the
leader, the teacher, the tribune of the people, the liberator&mdash;the
emancipation of the Russian serfs, for instance, was entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
due to the novel. He has serious work to do, and he does
it seriously. His eye is not upon rhetoric nor upon aesthetics,
but upon the evil he has to uproot, on the corruption he has
to expose, on the reform he has to institute, on the philosophy
of life he has to unfold, and to do that means the production
of a novel like "<i>Anna Karénina</i>" or of a play like "<i>The
Power of Darkness</i>." He speaks not to English or American
puritans, but to Russians, whose receptivity of strong, plain
speech is healthier than ours.</p>

<p class="is">Spoke as a prophet
and reformer.</p>

<p>Such a novelist was Tolstoy. His fiction is as powerful
as is the art of the Pre-Raphaelites. It is all sincerity. Nothing
escapes him. What the X-Ray does in the
physical world that his penetrating eye does in
the field of morals. He sees the sin through a thousand layers
of pretense and hypocrisy, and he describes it as he sees it.
Disagreeable as are some of the subjects of which he treats,
there is not a line that may not be read without a blush by the
pure-minded. Like a surgeon, who cuts into the sore for
the purpose of letting out the poison, he lays bare the wrongs
and rottenness of church and government for the purpose
of affecting the needed cure. As a prophet he speaks the
language of prophets. As a reformer he tells the truth as
reformers tell it, unvarnished and ungarnished. He spares
others as little as he spared himself in his book "<i>My Confession</i>."
He wants others to do as he has done, to subject the
lusts and appetites and greeds to the rule of conscience, if the
kingdom of God is ever to be established on earth.</p>

<p class="is">Opposed by
government.</p>

<p>Radical in his reform propositions from the first, he
attracted attention at once. The world was amazed at the
daring of his thought and at the plainness of his
speech, and hailed him as a new prophet. The
government, however, looked upon him as a revolutionist,
and gave him clearly to understand that he would be silenced
if he did not change his views and style of writing. Instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of complying with its wish, he became all the more daring in
thought and all the plainer in speech. The humblest peasant
could understand as clearly as the shrewdest diplomat what
he was after. And it was not long before the government was
after him. The publication and sale of certain of his books
were prohibited. They were read all the more outside of
Russia, and by the thousands of copies within Russia. And
the more they were read the larger loomed his world-fame,
till he became too large for banishment or prison, for fortress
or Siberian mine.</p>

<p class="is">Challenged
government to do
its worst.</p>

<p>With all the fiery zeal of an ancient Jewish prophet, he
challenged the government to do its worst, "to tighten the
well-soaped noose about his throat" as it tightened
it about the throats of thousands of better
men than any that are in the service of the autocrat
or of his hirelings, the bureaucrats. Theirs was a
government, he said, by might not by right, by gallows and
knout, not by law.</p>

<p class="is">His political
demands.</p>

<p>He demanded the abolition of the throne and of capital
punishment, the disbanding of the army, and the discontinuance
of trial by court-martial. He demanded
liberty of speech and freedom of conscience.
He demanded the surrender to the people of lands and rights
that justly belonged to them, and scathingly he denounced
those who wasted in riotousness what had been painfully
gotten together with the heart's blood of the laboring-people.
He denounced the government for its cruelty toward the Jews,
and charged it with having instigated the massacres of them.
He held the government responsible for every misfortune that
befell the country&mdash;war, famine, pestilence, intense poverty,
hopeless misery, appalling ignorance. In burning words he
charged the slaughter of tens of thousands of husbands and
fathers and sons, in the Japanese war, to the greed of the mighty.
He depicted the Duma as the laughing stock of the world, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
composed of people so stupid as not even to recognize what
fools they were making of themselves. In his "<i>Resurrection</i>"
he held up to the view of the world Russia's courts of law,
and her iniquitous prison-system, the blocking of justice, the
shocking judicial indifference and laxities in cases involving
life-long sentences to penal servitude, the "lives that are shed
like water upon the ground" during the transport to Siberia,
and the crimes and rebellions that are systematically bred by
such crying injustice.</p>

<p>Little wonder that the government had no love for Tolstoy,
and that it suppressed publication after publication of his, and
maintained a special corps of censors and spies to watch him.
Little wonder that it prohibited demonstrations of sorrow at
the announcement of his death, and made use of the church
as a cat's paw for holding him up as the Anti-Christ, and
arch-fiend, as the enemy of the Czar, Church and people.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="is">His demands of
the people.</p>

<p>Plain and fearless as was his speech to the government it
was yet more so to the people. Not a wrong in society,
public or private, which he did not know, and
which he did not castigate as only he knew
how to castigate. Louder and louder, as he grew older, he
preached the Law of God against the law of degenerate
society. Art and science, commerce and industry were to him
as nothing in comparison with the Moral Law, without which
he saw no future for mankind.</p>

<p class="is">His views respecting
marriage and
society.</p>

<p>The sanctity of the marriage tie, the sobriety and industry
of the husband, the domesticity of the wife, were among the
most constant of his themes. He loathed the
self-exhibiting society woman; in his eyes she
was no better than the street-woman. Great to
him was the womanly woman, greater the domestic wife,
greatest of all the mother, and so many more times greater
the more times she was mother.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">His views respecting
labor and capital.</p>

<p>The sad lot of the poor and the riotous extravagances of
the rich were constantly recurrent subjects of discussion with
him. "We speak of the abolition of slavery,"
said he, "but we have abolished only the word,
the poor are enslaved as much as ever. We need
a new emancipation, the emancipation of the rich from the
tyranny of their money, from the thraldom of the false view
of themselves and of society. With what right do men speak
of the abolition of slavery, when every time they look into the
mirror they see a slave-driver, when they live in idleness, and
fatten on the heart's blood of the down-trodden, when they
indulge their stomachs with the choicest of dainties, and wrap
their bodies in silks and broad cloths and furs, while those,
whose slavish toil provides these luxuries and comforts, have
not enough food to keep body and soul together, nor enough
of raiment and shelter to keep from freezing?"</p>

<p>In an article, published a few years ago in the <i>North
American Review</i>, Tolstoy spoke of a group of peasants standing
aside to let a picknicking party of rich folks drive by.
One of the ladies' hats "has cost more than the horse with
which the peasant plows the field," and for the gentleman's
riding stick has been paid a week's wages of an underground
workman. "Everywhere, two or three men in a thousand
live so that, doing nothing for themselves, they eat and drink
in one week what would have fed hundreds for a year; they
wear garments costing thousands of dollars; they live in palaces,
where thousands of workmen could have been housed;
and they spend upon their caprices the fruits of thousands and
tens of thousands of working days. The others, sleepless and
unfed, labor beyond their strength, ruining their moral and
physical health for the benefit of these few chosen ones." It
is natural that the rich should not object to this arrangement,
said he, the surprising thing is that the poor take it so complacently.
"Why do all these men, strong in physical vigor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and in the habit of labor&mdash;the enormous majority of humanity&mdash;why
do they submit to and obey a handful of feeble men,
generally incapable of anything?" Tolstoy finds the answer
very simple. It is because the minority have money, and the
workingmen need the money to feed their families. Millions
of workingmen submit "because one man has usurped
the factory, another the land, and a third the taxes collected
from the workmen." Were the millions, who now slave for
the rich, to get their food from the soil, the rich, to keep alive,
would be obliged to raise their own food, and the double
redemption would have begun. It is because the number of
workers who produce the prime necessities of life is diminishing
that the number of those who use luxuries is increasing.
Under such conditions, the health of society, wrote he, is as
little possible as is the health of that person, whose body is
continually growing heavier in weight, and his legs are continually
growing thinner and weaker. When the support
vanishes the body must fall.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="is">His Remedy.</p>

<p>As a bitter opponent of violent measures, he saw but
one way for righting the wrongs of society, and that is in
the well-to-do descending to the lowly and starting
life anew with them on a common level, and
rising with them step by step to the higher planes. And to
prevent a relapse to the old iniquitous state, he advocated
the eradication of capital, which he held responsible for many
of the inequalities and tyrannies and miseries of society. Let
the rich, said he, convert their money into land and parcel it out
among the poor, and claim for themselves no more than an
equal share with the others. Merely wishing the poor well, and
yet continuing the old state of affairs, is like sitting on a man's
neck and crushing him down, yet all the time assuring him
and others that we are sorry for him, and wish to ease his
condition by every means in our power except by getting off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his back. Or it is like entering an orchard, and barring the
door behind, and gathering its fruit for ourselves, and wishing
others might have as much yet continuing to keep the door
barred and gathering for ourselves alone.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>If we really wish to see the lot of the poor improved, said
he, we must not look for a miracle to effect it nor trust to some
future age to bring it about. We must do it ourselves, and
we must do it now. And we must do it at the cost of self-sacrifice.
If people really wish to improve the condition of
their brother men, and not merely their own, they must be
ready not only to alter the way of life to which they are accustomed,
but they must be ready for an intense struggle with
themselves and their families.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Society will never be at peace, said he, until man will
have learned the service of sacrifice. And man will never be
happy until he will have learned to find his happiness in
making others happy.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h2>My Visit to Tolstoy<br />
<span class="medium">(<i>Concluded.</i>)</span></h2>

<p class="center smcap">A Discourse, at Temple Keneseth Israel,<br />
by<br />
Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, D. D.</p>

<p class="center">Philadelphia, January 8th, 1911.</p>

<p class="is">Tolstoy's fatal
flight.</p>

<p>The world was amazed, a few weeks ago, at the news
that Tolstoy had fled from his family and home, with the
resolve to retire to some wilderness, there to
await his end. Guesses as to the cause were
many, and the opinion was quite general that extreme old age
had affected his reason.</p>


<p class="is">Explained in light
of last article of
his.</p>

<p>I could not subscribe to this conclusion, neither could I
see anything strange in his sudden departure. I knew of a
number of similar flights in his life, and the
reasons for them, and, therefore, I was little
surprised. And as to suspecting him of failing
mentality, I had but a short time before read the latest of his
writings, entitled "<i>Three Days in a Village</i>," in which I had
seen no sign of a lessening of his power of mind and heart and
soul. And it is obvious that the Russian government, likewise,
saw no lessening of his mentality, for it promptly suppressed
the publication of it. An enterprising newspaper man,
however, succeeded in forwarding a copy to our country,
which enterprise not only rescued for us the last of Tolstoy's
writings but also furnished us an explanation of his sudden
and fatal flight.</p>

<p class="is">Divided into three
parts.</p>

<p>The article, a comparatively short one, was divided into
three parts, each a heart-rending recital of miseries
in villages neighboring the count's estate.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p class="is">First part
described peasant
poverty.</p>

<p>The first part deals with wayfaring men. From six to
twelve of them visit these villages daily in search of bread and
clothes, of work and shelter. Some are blind or
lame, some sick or feeble, some are very old or
very young, some are maimed or crippled, dragging
with them hideous memories of the recent Japanese war.
Many of them are ignorant and filthy, but some of them are
intelligent and revolutionary, who look upon the prosperous
as thieves, and ask for their share of the coined blood pressed
from the hearts of the poor and down-trodden. To keep these
unceasing streams of wayfaring paupers from becoming a
government charge, they are parcelled out by the authorities
among the poor and helpless peasantry, good care being taken
that they are not loaded upon the landlords, merchants or
priests. The wickedness of this course is fully intelligible
only to those who have some conception of the indescribable
poverty and misery of Russian peasants. Stripped of almost
all by taxation and by landlord oppression and by priest and
constable extortion, many of them have scarcely food and
room enough for themselves and cattle, scarcely clothes enough
to cover their nakedness, no money with which to buy the
absolutely necessary farming-implements, or to keep their
wretched hovels from toppling over their heads. And yet,
notwithstanding their appalling misery, Tolstoy saw their
hearts go out in pity to these wandering paupers, and religiously
dividing their crust with those yet more unfortunate
than they, not knowing how soon they themselves might be
in a similarly wretched plight.</p>

<p class="is">Second part
described peasant
misery.</p>

<p>The second part of the article bears the sub-title "<i>Living
and Dying</i>." Upon entering the village accompanied by his
physician, the count was entreated for aid by a
woman. Upon inquiry he learned that her husband
had been drafted into the army, and that
the family was starving. Upon asking the village authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
why the law had been violated in taking from a family its sole
supporter, he was told that the husband's brother was quite
capable of supporting the family. Next he met a little orphan
girl twelve years old, who was the head of a family of five
children. Her father had been killed in a mine; her mother
had dropped dead from exhaustion, a few weeks after; poor but
kind-hearted neighbors kept their eyes on the children, whilst
the oldest went about begging the means for their support.
In another hovel he found a man in his death-throes with
pneumonia. The room was damp and cold; there was no fuel
for the stove; no food, no medicine, no mattress, no pillow,
for the dying man.</p>

<p class="is">Contrasted with
extravagance in
his own family.</p>

<p>Saddened by what he had seen and heard the count drove
home. In front of his house he saw a carpeted sleigh, drawn
by magnificent horses, driven by a coachman
attired in heavy fur-coat and cap. It was the
conveyance of the count's son, who had come on
a visit to his father. There were ten at the table, who partook
of a dinner of four courses, spiced by two kinds of wine.
Two butlers were in attendance, and costly flowers were on
the table. "Whence came these orchids?" asked the son,
to which the mother replied that they had come all the way
from St. Petersburg. "They cost a ruble and a half a piece,"
said the son, adding that at a recent concert the whole stage
was smothered with orchids. Another at the table talked of
a little recreation trip to Italy, but thought it troublesome to
be obliged to spend thirty-nine hours in an express train, and
regretted that aviation had not proceeded far enough to make
possible a trip to Italy in shorter time. The count contrasted
these table sights and sounds with those he had seen and heard
in the village in the course of the day, and he left the table
even sadder than he was when he came to it.</p>

<p class="is">Third part
described peasant
oppression.</p>

<p>The third part of the article deals with the taxation of the
villagers. From one old peasant the tax collectors took his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
samovar&mdash;the brass kettle for making tea&mdash;as
indispensable to a Russian as a stove is to us.
From another, a widow, they took a sheep; from
another they took a cow, and so on. One poor woman offered
him some linen at the price of two rubles, the amount she
needed for taxes, saying that, if she failed to make the sale,
they will seize not only the linen but also her chickens, her
only means of support. That women play so large a part in
these taxations is due to so many of the men having been
killed in the Japanese war, or serving in the army. Upon
remonstrating with the village authorities, he was told that
they were sorry for the poor people, but helpless, that they
had received instructions from headquarters to be unsparing
in the discharge of their duty. Upon visiting the district chief
he was made clearly to recognize that back of his severity lay
his ambition for promotion as a reliable, immovable government
official.</p>

<p class="is">Felt that all his
labors had been
in vain.</p>

<p>Little wonder, that the government suppressed the publication
of this last of Tolstoy's writings. Little wonder, that
the three days spent amid the miseries of the
villagers saddened his heart beyond endurance.
And still less wonder, that the government's
responsibility for it, and the world's indifference to it, even
his own family's, drove him to despair, ripened in him the
resolve to retire to some wilderness, where the soul would no
longer be harrowed by the sight of human outrages and
sufferings.</p>

<p>In the midst of such miseries as he saw, he must have
felt that the more than half a century of unceasing labors
in behalf of the poor and down-trodden, all his renunciations
and sacrifices had all been in vain. He must have felt that
the lot of the peasant was as bad as ever, that the government
was as cruel as before, that all his writings and all his pleadings
for a more equitable division of God's gifts had failed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
make the slightest impression upon the people, judging by the
extravagances within his own family, seeing four courses of
delicacies on his own table, at a single meal, two kinds of
wine, costly orchids, when, at but a short distance away, men
and women, even children, working infinitely harder than any
of his own family, deserving infinitely more than any who
lord it over them, were literally starving for the want of the
necessities of life, were dying in agony for the want of medical
care and ordinary comforts, had their last possession taken
from them by pitiless tax-collectors for the support of a vast
army of soldiers and officials, for the maintenance of a costly
and an oppressive autocracy.</p>

<p class="is">Noted his discontent
when in conversation
with him.</p>

<p>Even as far back as 1894, when he was sixteen years
younger than he was at the time of his flight, even then I
noted in my conversations with him an undercurrent
of deep sorrow when dwelling on the
sufferings of the people, an occasional outburst
of impatience at the slowness of progress, and now and then
a cry of despair, an utter hopelessness of ever seeing a state of
society different from what it was.</p>

<p class="is">Those responsible
for wrongs charged
him with irreligion.</p>

<p>What seemed to vex him most was seeing the very people
who were responsible for these wrongs and outrages considering
themselves religious, and branding as infamous
such a man as he whose sole cry was for
justice and right. "Because they mumble so
many prayers a day," said he to me, when speaking of
Pobdiedonostzief, "and cross themselves so many times, and
fast so many days in the year, they consider themselves
Christian, as for the rest of their conduct, one finds it difficult
to believe that they had ever heard of the <i>Sermon on the Mount</i>,
of the <i>Golden Rule</i> or of the <i>Mosaic command" "Thou shall love
thy neighbor as thyself."</i> Asking me for an explanation of
Reform Judaism, and telling him that is was founded upon an
emphasis on the spirit of religion rather than on its forms, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
replied that it would not be tolerated in Russia, that the mere
words Reform and Spirit were quite sufficient to condemn it.
The government knows that they who seek the Spirit also
seek the Truth, and it is afraid that Truth will overthrow
autocracy and hierarchy, blind obedience and stupid ceremony,
and will set men free.</p>

<p class="is">Few men had
studied religion
as much as he.</p>

<p>There are many things in connection with Tolstoy which
Russia of the future will wish to see expunged from the pages
of its history, and chief of these will be its having
branded him as infamously irreligious. Few men
have been as genuinely religious as he. Few
men have given religion as much thought as he. Few men
have written on religious subjects as much as he.</p>

<p class="is">Rebelled against
adulteration of
religion.</p>

<p>He studied the Scriptures in the original languages, and
carefully he read Church doctrine and dogmatic theology,
and the more he read the firmer became his conviction
that <i>Christ's Christianity</i> was quite a different
thing from <i>Church Christianity</i>. He rejected
the latter, and fervently he espoused the former.
Three-fourth of what passes for Christianity, he said, has
no historical nor logical nor spiritual warrant. He saw how
its fundamental principle, the equality of all men as sons of
God, had been perverted to give the classes the right to enslave
the masses. He saw how a divine being had been made of Jesus,
and how this enabled the church to say that living the life he
lived, and practicing the precepts he preached was impossible
for human beings. He had read in the Scriptures not to resist
evil, and yet had been taught the soldier's trade, the art of
killing. The army to which he had belonged was called "The
Christophile Army," and it was sent forth with a Christian
benediction. One day, he said, he was reading in Hebrew,
with a Rabbi, the fifth chapter of Matthew. After nearly
every verse the Rabbi said "This is in the Old Testament or
in the Talmud," and showed me the corresponding passages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
When we reached the words "Resist no evil," the Rabbi did
not say "This is in the Talmud," but he asked "Do the
Christians obey this command? Do they turn the other
cheek?" "I had nothing to say in reply," said Tolstoy,
"for at that particular time, Christians, far from turning the
other cheek, were smiting the Jews upon both cheeks. I saw
the support the church gave to persecutions and to the death
penalty, and my soul cried out against it."</p>

<p>And his mind rebelled, he said and wrote, against the
mythology which was paraded as theology, such teachings as
the immaculate conception, the heaven opening and the angels
singing, Christ's flying through the air and into the sky, and
seating himself at the right hand of God. He denounced as
blasphemous such teachings as that by partaking of the Sacrament
God's body becomes assimilated with that of man, or that
of God being three Gods in one, being still angry at man for the
sin of Adam, and sending His only son on earth to be crucified
so that by the son's blood the father's wrath may be appeased.
He regarded as unworthy even of heathens such teachings as
that salvation for sin depended on being baptized, and that
God will visit eternal punishment on those who do not believe
in His divinely begotten son. He professed a sincere belief in
God as the author of all existence, and as the source of all
love. He believed that death meant a new and higher birth.
He believed that God's will was most clearly expressed in the
teachings of the man Jesus, whom to consider and pray to as
God he regarded as blasphemous.</p>

<p class="is">Compressed
religion into five
commandments.</p>

<p>He compressed the teachings of Jesus into the following
commandments: I. "Do not be angry. II. Do not lust.
III. Do not give away the control of your future
actions by taking oaths. IV. Do not resist evil.
V. Do not withhold love from any one." These
five commandments he developed into a comprehensive moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
philosophy, and by it he conscientiously endeavored to guide
his life and thought.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="is">Was indebted for
his faith to
peasants.</p>

<p>And for that strong and simple faith of his, which is
destined, in the not distant future, to inaugurate an era in the
religious world similar to that which Luther
inaugurated four centuries earlier in Germany,
he was indebted to the peasants. During the
libertine life of his early years, he had lost the little faith that
had been taught him in his childhood. He had returned to
his estate an avowed atheist, and as such had he continued for
some time, until, one day, he inquired into what it was that
made the wretchedly poor and ignorant and hard-working
peasants contented with their lot, resigned to their fate, bearing
hardships and sufferings unmurmuringly, and looking
happily forward to the end. He found it in their faith.
"Surely," said he, "a state of mind that can do so much for
the poor is worth having by all." And he devoted himself to
a diligent study of their religion. He found it burdened with
foreign accretions, contaminated with a putrid mass that had
been gathered during centuries of darkness and superstition,
adulterated with all kinds of conscious and unconscious inventions.
Stripping away the foreign and putrid and false, he
alighted upon a rational, satisfying faith, the faith which he
believed to have been that of the Rabbi of Nazareth, and,
henceforth, consecrated his life to the propagation of it.</p>

<p class="is">Gave them his life
and labor in return.</p>

<p>And more yet than what the peasants gave to him he
gave to them in return. He gave them himself, and, in the
end, he sacrificed even his life for them. He
found them down-trodden serfs, he endeavored
to make free men of them. He found them cowed and bowed,
he taught them to walk and stand erect. He found them
unbefriended, he became a brother to them. He found them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
wretchedly poor, he renounced pleasure and treasure, luxury
and ease, to lessen as much as he could the distance between
them and himself. He dressed as they dressed, and labored
as they labored, and, as far as permitted, ate the kind of food
they ate. He found them stalking in darkness, he brightened
their way for them. He found them ignorant and at the
mercy of priest and government official, he became their advocate,
dared to brave an all-powerful autocracy in the defense
of their rights. He started schools for them. He gave up
writing for the thousands of select readers that he might write
for the millions of illiterate peasants and other laborers. He
wrote special booklets for them, and sold them at a loss, at
one-half cent a copy, stories, legends, symbolical tales, moral
plays and religious tracts, all fitted for their minds and
stations, and intended to deepen in them the law of love and
right.</p>

<p class="is">Died believing he
had failed.</p>

<p>To have sacrificed and renounced and dared as much and
as long as he had, and, in the end, to find what he found, in
his three days observation of village miseries
and outrages, was more than his great heart
could stand. It broke. He was eighty-two years old. He
could no longer continue the fight. He could no longer look
upon the suffering of the unfortunates, nor upon the wrongs
of the world, nor upon the extravagances even within his own
family. He regarded his whole life-work a dismal failure.
He knew of no other balm for his bleeding heart than flight
from the world to some secluded spot, there, as a hermit, to
await the end, which he knew was not far distant. Truly
pathetic were his farewell lines to his wife:</p>



<p class="i2">"I cannot continue longer to live a life of ease and luxury while
others starve and suffer. Like many other old men, I retire from the
world to await my end in solitude. I ask that you do not seek my
place of sojourn, and that you do not come to it if it be discovered.
I beg forgiveness for the grief that I may cause you."</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<p class="is">Characteristic of
great reformers.</p>

<p>He was not the first of the world's great reformers and
lovers of humanity to lose heart and to experience spells of
despair. Moses and Elijah and Jesus and others
had their hours of agony, and prayed that the
end might come, and deliver them from their hopeless labors.
And many who, like Tolstoy, closed their eyes in the belief
that they had utterly failed loomed large in subsequent ages
among the greatest of the world's benefactors.</p>

<p class="is">Succeeded better
than he knew.</p>

<p>Tolstoy has not failed. He succeeded better than he
knew. His pathetic death revealed the vast number of followers
he had in his own country and in all parts
of the world. And had he cared to inquire, he
might have known it before his death. He could have seen
it from the fact that more books of his were sold than of all
other Russian authors combined. He could have seen it in the
vast crowds that gathered all along the line, to catch a glimpse
of him, when on his journey, a few years ago, to the Crimea,
in search of health. He could have seen it in the deputations
of sympathizers that waited upon him, and in the streams of
congratulatory letters and telegrams that rushed in upon him&mdash;till
suppressed&mdash;after his excommunication. He could have
seen it in the Tolstoyan societies among the students of almost
all the Russian universities and among other bodies. He
could have seen it among the considerable number of landlords,
who made conscientious efforts at following his life, and at
adopting his mode of dealing with peasants and laborers.
Were the yoke of autocracy removed, there would arise in
Russia an army of Tolstoyans as vast and mighty as the host
which Ezekiel in his vision saw in the valley of dry bones.</p>

<p class="is">Religion of future
will be largely
Tolstoyan.</p>

<p>The religion of Russia of the future will be largely that
which Tolstoy lived and taught, and it will be the religion of
a large part of the rest of the world. Time's
sifting process will eliminate whatever is untenable
in his system of moral and social and eco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>nomic
philosophy, which sprang more from a flaming heart
than from a cool, calculating mind. He had neither the time
nor the inclination to work out a synthetic philosophy. He
wrote as the spirit moved him, and whenever it moved him,
the keynote of all his writing having been, as he said to me,
"the hastening of the day when men will dwell together in
the bonds of love, and sin and suffering will be no more."</p>

<p>There are in the Tolstoyan system of religion the elements
of the long-dreamed of universal creed. It will take time for
the rooting of it. Mormonism and Dowieism spring up, like
Jonah's gourd, and pass away as speedily as they came. A
system as rational and radical as that of Tolstoy requires an
age for germination. But, once it takes root, it takes root
forever; once it blossoms, it blossoms for eternity.</p>
